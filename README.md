# horse controller

code for a midi controller using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express. bluetooth midi is tha future

## dependencies

i'm using platformio instead of arduino because i wanna use real c++ and not that little fucking mutant thing arduino insists on. other libraries used (other than bluefruit, the board's core library):

- [Adafruit DotStar](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar) (for the neat little rgb light on the board)
- [MIDI Library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library) (for um midi)


## setup and usage

i'm gatekeeping
